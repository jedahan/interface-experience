# [Interface Experience][]

Here is a collection of interactives built for the Bard Graduate Center Focus Gallery


It includes 5 applications, built for the Commodore 64, Mac Plus, Palm Pilot, iPad, and Kinect.

It's an OK set of examples for someone trying to write code for these platforms around 2015. I owe a ton of thanks to many people who have put up great tutorials for each system, as detailed at the end of this document.

I could not have created this without the help of

  * [Kimon Keramidas][] and the [Bard Graduate Center][], for giving me the opportunity to work on this amazingly fun archeological experiment.
  * All the students who created the scripts and everyone who created the [Interface Experience Wiki][]: Jane Killmar, Andrew Gardner, Caitlin Dichter, Amily Abanas, Cindy Kok, Martina D Amato, Rebecca Mir, ... theres a bunch more I am missing...
  * the [Kryoflux Project][], for making a killer floppy disk controller to let me dump Hypercard and other variable speed floppy disks, and it working flawlessly. 
  * [the Future was 8-bit][] for their [SD2IEC][] sd card drive for the commodore...
  * [eBay][], for the only place I could find a shrink-wrapped Claris Hypercard 2.1, an excellent condition palm pilot m500 + 802.11b MODULE?!?
  * [mini vMac][]/[the Gryphel Project][], a kickass linux/osx mac plus emulator
  * [Bill Atkinson][] for making Hypercard! And Claris for extending it!
  * [PHEM][], the palm hardware emulator for Android 
  * [Eric Poncet][], for his amazing Palm Tutorial
  * [Docker][], for making it easy to create a crazy gcc 2.95 + pilrc palm pilot compiler environment
  * [Debian][], for keeping sources and packages still alive for years after end-of-life
